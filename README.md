<p class="" data-start="1068" data-end="1442"><strong data-start="1068" data-end="1100">Short-Term vs. Long-Term Use</strong>: Some medical supplies are used temporarily, such as bandages after a minor injury, while others are used long-term, like incontinence products or home care equipment. Depending on your needs, this will impact the type of store you should choose. Stores specializing in long-term care items might be better suited for more complex purchases.</p>
